I have done the coding test in Angular 11 version.

PREREQUESITES:

Node Version: 14.17.3

Below are the steps needs to follow to run the project:

#) Once the page loads user can see three buttons show table , show form and show card .
#) If user clicks showTable button then Part -3 table functions will show and respectively same for other 2 buttons as well.
